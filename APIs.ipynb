    "An API is a system for transferring data over the internet. As users, we have to supply four things:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * a \"root\": the beginning of the URL that leads to all APIs that one data provider maintains\n",
    "  * an \"endpoint\": the later part of the URL, leading to one specific API\n",
    "  * parameters: the arguments the API expects us to provide along with the root and endpoint that control features about the data the API sends back to us (such as date range, etc)\n",
    "  * headers: additional information that we supply to the API to let them know who we are and what our system is\n",
    "\n",
    "Many APIs require credentials/keys, and different APIs ask that we provide the key as either a parameter or a header.\n",
    "\n",
    "But by far the most important skill for APIs is the ability to find and use the API documentation. Your goal in reading the documentation is finding out what the API requires with respect to the root, endpoint, parameters, and headers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the congress.gov API, start with the documentation here: https://api.congress.gov\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many endpoints, but (if you look at the examples) they all begin with https://api.congress.gov/v3. Let's set that as the root:"
